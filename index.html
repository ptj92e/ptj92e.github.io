    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <p>My name is Phillip Jones and I love to code and play music.</p>

    <p>My instrument of choice is Trombone and I have been playing for 13 years. I have played with professional groups like the Intersection Music Ensemble and the Nashville Opera. I have also had a lot of fun playing trombone in a friend's band that covered 70's and 80's funk style music.</p>
